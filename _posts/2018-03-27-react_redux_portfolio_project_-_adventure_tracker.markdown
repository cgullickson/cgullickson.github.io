For my final portfolio project I chose to create an application that allows its users to document the many adventures they take over the course of their lives called Adventure Tracker. I had a lot of fun creating this application and learned a great deal along the way. It was definitely the most rewarding project I have done to date, and I feel quite happy with the finished product.

In order to satisfy the project requirements, I ensured the following:

It is a single page application, created using a Rails API on the back-end for data persistence and a React/Redux front-end. It uses Redux's thunk middleware to handle asynchronous actions, and react-router to handle the routing and navigation. I also added some styling to the application using bootstrap and semantic-ui-react.

The application has three container components, the Adventures.js index page, the AdventureShow.js show page, and the AdventureForm.js form page. These are considered container components because they are aware of Redux. Adventure Tracker also has a some static components that are not aware of Redux, such as the Home page, About page, Contact page, Navbar, and the Adventure Card component. 

I hope to extend the features of this application as I delve deeper and learn more about the intricacies of React and Redux, but I am very proud of what I have to this point. Now on to the final project review and soon after, graduation!
