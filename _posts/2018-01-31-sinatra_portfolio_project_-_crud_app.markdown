For my Sinatra CRUD App Portfolio Project, I chose to make an app that allows its users to sell their snowboards on the internet. It was an excellent learning experience and I gained a ton of knowledge about Sinatra and ActiveRecord in the process! 

The homepage of my app has a welcome message followed by links to sign up, log in, see all snowboards available, and log out. Once a user is logged in, they have the option to add a new snowboard listing, where they can specify the model name, the brand, a description, contact information, and even include add-ons that come with the snowboard they're selling if they so choose.

The user then has the option to edit the snowboard they added for sale, delete the snowboard, edit the add-ons, delete add-ons, log out and let someone else log in, and look at all of the other snowboards that users have posted for sale, including their own.

All in all, I had a great time creating this web app and after having done so I feel much more comfortable with using Sinatra, ActiveRecord, and making CRUD apps in general!
