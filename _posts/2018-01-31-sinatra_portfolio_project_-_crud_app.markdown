For my Sinatra CRUD App Portfolio Project, I chose to make an app that allows its users to sell their snowboards on the internet. It was an excellent learning experience and I gained a ton of knowledge about Sinatra and ActiveRecord in the process! 

When I initially began making the app, I was aiming to make a site where people could post the different snowboards that they own and show off their collection. I then pivoted to making it a site that was more similar to craigslist, where people could post snowboards that they own and list them for sale. I made this change because it seemed like it was something that people would be more likely to use and look at on a daily basis. Now for a rundown of the capabilities of my app...

The homepage of the site has a welcome message followed by links to sign up, log in, see all snowboards available, and log out. Once a user is logged in, they have the option to add a new snowboard listing, where they can specify the model name, the brand, a description, contact information, and even include add-ons that come with the snowboard they're selling if they so choose.

The user then has the option to edit the snowboard they added for sale, delete the snowboard, edit the add-ons, delete add-ons, log out and let someone else log in, and look at all of the other snowboards that users have posted for sale, including their own.

All in all, I had a great time creating this web app and after having done so I feel much more comfortable with using Sinatra, ActiveRecord, and making CRUD apps in general!
