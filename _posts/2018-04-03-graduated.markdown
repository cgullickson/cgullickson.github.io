After nearly 5 months of hard work here at Flatiron School, I have made it to graduation! I am incredibly excited for what's in store for me going forward and cannot wait to get out there and get my first job as a software developer. I have already begun applying to companies around Denver and even a few for which I would have to relocate.

In addition to being excited about graduating, I am also excited to continue my journey of learning to code. I think I will begin with the Node.js track here at Flatiron that is unlocked after graduation, and then I would like to move on to Python and Java, as it seems those are popular languages in the job market here in Denver.

It has been a tough road to say the least, but I am incredibly happy that I made the decision to pursue this dream of mine. Many, many thanks to Flatiron School, it has been a wonderful experience every step of the way! Now on to the job search!
