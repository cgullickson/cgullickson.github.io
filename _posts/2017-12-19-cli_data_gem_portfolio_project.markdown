This project has been a fantastic learning experience for me thus far! I have learned a ton about scraping, object oriented programming, and creating command line interfaces, and I have been able to build an app that serves a purpose that is relevant to my interests! 

I decided to build a program that would list the 5 largest concerts in the Denver on any given night by venue size. The user is greeted with the list of the 5 concerts, and then they are prompted to select the concert for which they would like more information. Once their input is received by the program, the program then responds with the corresponding artist name, concert time, price, location, and a link with more information regarding the artist and the purchase of tickets. The user then has the option to enter a different concert, list the concerts again, or exit the program. Once the user is finished with the program and enters "exit", the program says goodbye and shuts down.

I am very happy with how the project turned out and excited to complete my first portfolio project assessment in the coming days :)
