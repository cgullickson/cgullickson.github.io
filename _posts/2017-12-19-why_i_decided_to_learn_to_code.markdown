I have been flirting with the idea of joining a bootcamp and realizing my dream of becoming a software developer for years, and it has always been something that I knew in the back of my mind would eventually happen. I have always wanted to build things that improve the lives of others, and I have always been interested in technology, so I think that the natural next step in my thinking has always been to try and parlay those interests into a full-time occupation.

My brother-in-law is an experienced software engineer and has been in the industry for about 20 years, and whenever I hear him talk about his job I can tell how much he enjoys it. The same goes for some other friends that I have in the field. Having people close to me who really enjoy their careers in software development was definitely another major deciding factor for me in deciding to begin Flatiron School when I did.

I have been loving my first month or so of learning to code here at Flatiron, and I can't wait to see what the next few months of schooling and my career beyond that have in store for me!
